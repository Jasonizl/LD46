Keep the fishes alive

- start with 2 fish
- goal is to populate the aquarium
- should be a more chill game early on but hectic later
- fish need different things to stay alive
-- food, oxygen for the fishes, cleaniness, happiness

- point-and-click style. You choose what you want to apply. Everytime you applied something, you need to choose again
- fishes that are happy enough, will make babies. they need a little less from everything until they grow up to be adult
- when they die they will make the aquarium dirty

- dirtyness level from 0 to 3 (3 means fast death basically)
- oxygen also gets impacted, and more fish mean more regular fixing of oxygen tank
- more fish = give more food
- the more fishes are in your tank, the unhappier they will become 
- score is basically maximum fishes you could hold
